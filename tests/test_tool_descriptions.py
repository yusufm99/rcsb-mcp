"""Deterministic guard for load-bearing tool-description content.

The search-tool docstrings were deduplicated — shared config detail (return types,
grouping, paging, faceting, ontology-resolver routing, assembly attributes) was moved
into the FastMCP ``instructions=`` block, and each docstring left a pointer. These
assertions lock in the cross-field rules and routing gotchas the JSON schema cannot
encode, so a future trim can't silently delete one (or gut the block a pointer targets).

No network, no API key, no model — this is the cheap CI gate. The behavioral A/B that
checks whether the model still *acts* on this text lives in ``evals/tool_selection/``.
