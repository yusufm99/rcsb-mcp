"""An MCP server for interrogating Protein Data Bank structures.

Spans three RCSB APIs so an LLM can take a question from discovery through detail:
- DISCOVER: search the Protein Data Bank (https://search.rcsb.org) by keyword,
  structural attribute, sequence, chemistry, 3D shape, or motif.
- INSPECT: fetch entry / entity / assembly / ligand metadata and annotations from
  the Data API (https://data.rcsb.org/graphql).
- RELATE: map alignments and positional annotations between sequence reference
  systems (UniProt, NCBI, PDB entity/instance) via the Sequence Coordinates API
  (https://sequence-coordinates.rcsb.org/graphql).

The Search API returns only identifiers, so search tools optionally enrich entry
hits with metadata from the Data API, and an entry's component ids let the agent
drill top-down into its entities, assemblies, and ligands.

Run locally (stdio, for Claude Desktop / MCP Inspector):
    python -m rcsb_mcp.server

    instructions="""You are an assistant for interrogating Protein Data Bank structures via the
RCSB Search, Data, and Sequence Coordinates APIs. You can:
- DISCOVER structures — find identifiers with the rcsb_search_* tools (keyword, attribute,
  sequence, chemical, 3D shape, structural/sequence motif), count them (rcsb_search_count),
  or aggregate them into buckets (rcsb_search_facets).
- INSPECT structures — fetch detailed properties, experimental info, and annotations with
  the rcsb_get_* tools; use rcsb_describe_data_object to discover further fields to request.
- RELATE sequences — map alignments and positional features across PDB, UniProt, and NCBI
  with the rcsb_seqcoord_* tools.

Interrogation is usually multi-step; chain tools rather than relying on a single call:
- Find then detail: a search returns ids of ONE return_type — batch them into the matching
  rcsb_get_* tool for details (see "Return types and fetching details" below).
- Top-down: rcsb_get_entries returns an entry's component ids (rcsb_entry_container_identifiers:
  polymer/non-polymer/branched entity ids and assembly ids) — compose them with the entry id
  and feed them to rcsb_get_polymer_entities / rcsb_get_nonpolymer_entities / rcsb_get_assemblies, etc.
- Cross-reference: map an entry/entity to UniProt or NCBI with rcsb_seqcoord_alignments, and pull
  positional features with rcsb_seqcoord_annotations.

Choosing a search tool:
- When the request resolves to a clear attribute and value (e.g. resolution < 2 Å,
  organism = Homo sapiens, method = X-RAY DIFFRACTION, released after a date), prefer a
  STRUCTURED search: if you don't already know the exact attribute path, call
  rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes to find it, then use rcsb_search_by_attribute (or
  rcsb_search_combined when several conditions apply). This is more precise than keyword search.
- Use rcsb_search_fulltext only for broad or exploratory keyword lookups where no specific
  attribute and value apply, or when the right search terms aren't yet known.
- Searches return up to `limit` hits (default 10, max 100) plus pagination fields
  (offset/has_more/next_offset). For more results, re-issue the same query with offset set to
  the response's next_offset — don't just raise limit past 100.
- When the user asks for ALL matches (to enumerate or batch-fetch a complete set), set
  all_hits=True on rcsb_search_fulltext / rcsb_search_by_attribute / rcsb_search_combined to
  get the whole set in one call instead of paging. It is capped at 10000 hits; above that,
  narrow the query or summarize with rcsb_search_facets / rcsb_search_count instead.

Other capabilities:
- For "how many ..." questions, use rcsb_search_count (count only) rather than fetching and
  counting hits.
- For "break down / distribution / per X" questions (e.g. structures per experimental
  method, per release year, per organism), use rcsb_search_facets to aggregate matches into
  buckets instead of paging through results.
- rcsb_search_strucmotif finds structures sharing a 3D arrangement of specific residues (a
  geometric motif); this is different from rcsb_search_by_structure (whole-shape similarity).
- To search chemical-component attributes (chem_comp.*, drugbank_info.*, rcsb_chem_comp_*),
  call rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes(schema="chemical") to find the path, then pass chemical=True
  to rcsb_search_by_attribute / rcsb_search_combined (usually with return_type="mol_definition").
- For a request about an assembled COMPLEX / molecular machine / multi-subunit structure (e.g.
  baseplate, ribosome, nucleosome, capsid, proteasome) there is usually no single attribute for
  the whole complex — with rcsb_search_combined, pair a full_text keyword for the concept with
  rcsb_assembly_info.* composition filters to keep assembled complexes and drop isolated
  single-component structures: polymer_entity_instance_count_protein (total protein chains, e.g.
  greater_or_equal 6), polymer_entity_count_protein (distinct subunits, e.g. greater 1 for
  heteromeric), or polymer_composition exact_match "heteromeric protein". Set the threshold from
  intent — a higher chain count favors the assembled machine, while a low or no filter also keeps
  component structures. This refines the keyword; it is not a standalone complex-type filter.
- For requests about a molecular FUNCTION ("kinase activity"), biological PROCESS ("DNA repair"),
  or cellular COMPONENT / location ("mitochondrial membrane"), first call rcsb_find_go_terms to resolve
  the phrase to a Gene Ontology id, then search with
  rcsb_polymer_entity_annotation.annotation_lineage.id exact_match "GO:..." (matches the term and
  all its descendants). This is far more precise than keyword search. Prefer terms with a higher
  pdb_entry_count; use the "in" operator with several GO ids to broaden.
- For requests referencing a protein DOMAIN, FAMILY, or fold ("SH2 domain", "immunoglobulin fold",
  "kinase domain"), first call rcsb_find_interpro_domains to resolve it to an InterPro id, then search
  with rcsb_polymer_entity_annotation.annotation_id exact_match "IPR..." (add .type="InterPro" to be
  explicit; "in" with several IPR ids to broaden). Note: for InterPro use annotation_id (NOT
  annotation_lineage.id — its hierarchy is not expanded). Prefer higher pdb_entry_count.
- For requests about an ENZYME activity / class ("alcohol dehydrogenase", "DNA polymerase", "EC
  3.4.21"), first call rcsb_find_enzyme_classes to resolve it to an EC number, then search with
  rcsb_polymer_entity.rcsb_ec_lineage.id exact_match "<EC>" (hierarchical: a full EC finds that
  enzyme, a partial EC like "3.4.21" finds the whole sub-subclass; "in" with several to broaden).
  Prefer higher pdb_entry_count.
- For requests about a DISEASE or condition ("cystic fibrosis", "breast cancer"), first call
  rcsb_find_disease_terms to resolve it to a MONDO id, then search with
  rcsb_uniprot_annotation.annotation_lineage.id exact_match "MONDO:..." (UniProt-based disease
  annotation; lineage matches the disease and its subtypes; "in" with several to broaden).
  Prefer higher pdb_entry_count.
- For requests restricting by SOURCE ORGANISM or a higher taxon ("human", "mouse", "mammals",
  "bacteria", "Escherichia coli"), first call rcsb_find_organisms to resolve it to an NCBI taxon
  id, then search with rcsb_entity_source_organism.taxonomy_lineage.id exact_match "<taxId>" —
  pass the id as a STRING ("9606", not 9606). The lineage is each entity's full ancestor chain,
  so a species id finds that species and a clade id (e.g. "40674" = Mammalia) finds every
  organism beneath it; "in" with several to broaden. For a known exact species,
  ncbi_scientific_name exact_match also works. Prefer higher pdb_entry_count.
- FALLBACK: if a rcsb_find_* resolver returns no usable match (count 0, or all results have
  pdb_entry_count 0), the concept isn't covered by that ontology — fall back to a keyword search
  (rcsb_search_fulltext, or rcsb_search_combined with a full_text term) for it. The resolver's response
  carries a "note" saying so. Also use full text for concepts no ontology covers (tissues, broad
  phenotypes, free-text descriptors).

Return types and fetching details:
- Every search returns identifiers of ONE return_type. The six valid types — with an example
  id and the Data API tool that fetches their full details — are:
    entry              whole structure      "4HHB"     -> rcsb_get_entries
    polymer_entity     one molecule         "4HHB_1"   -> rcsb_get_polymer_entities
    non_polymer_entity ligand entity        "4HHB_3"   -> rcsb_get_nonpolymer_entities
    polymer_instance   one chain            "4HHB.A"   -> rcsb_get_polymer_entity_instances
    assembly           biological assembly  "4HHB-1"   -> rcsb_get_assemblies
    mol_definition     chemical component   "HEM"      -> rcsb_get_chem_comps
- The search tools' `enrich` flag auto-attaches entry metadata ONLY when return_type="entry".
  For any other return_type, take the returned ids and call the matching rcsb_get_* tool above
  (batch all ids into a single call) to get details — do not loop one id at a time.
- The rcsb_get_* and rcsb_seqcoord_* tools return a compact default field set. If you need a property
  they don't return, call rcsb_describe_data_object (Data API) or rcsb_describe_seqcoord_object
  (Sequence Coordinates) with [into=, query=] to find the exact field path, then pass it to
  the tool's `fields=` argument.
- Every search/Data/Sequence-Coordinates tool response includes a link to the interactive
  query editor for that exact request — `query_editor_url` (search) or `graphiql_url`
  (GraphQL). When you show your work, surface that link verbatim; never construct these
  URLs yourself."""

    Best for broad or exploratory keyword lookups. When the request resolves to a
    clear attribute and value (resolution, organism, experimental method, ligand,
    release date, sequence length, ...), prefer `rcsb_search_by_attribute` (or
    `rcsb_search_combined`) instead — call `rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes` first to find the
    exact attribute path and operators. Attribute search is more precise and avoids
    spurious keyword matches.

    BEFORE keyword-searching a biological CONCEPT, try to resolve it to an ontology id first
    and filter on the annotation (far more precise):
      - disease / condition (e.g. "diabetes", "cancer")   -> rcsb_find_disease_terms
      - molecular function / process / location            -> rcsb_find_go_terms
      - protein domain / family / fold                     -> rcsb_find_interpro_domains
      - enzyme / catalyzed reaction                        -> rcsb_find_enzyme_classes
      - organism common name / clade (e.g. "human", "mammals") -> rcsb_find_organisms
    Each returns ids to use with rcsb_search_by_attribute on the matching annotation attribute.
    If a resolver finds no usable match (count 0, or all pdb_entry_count 0), the concept isn't
    covered by that ontology — THEN fall back to a keyword search here for the concept.

    If the CONCEPT is an assembled COMPLEX / multi-subunit machine (baseplate, ribosome, capsid,
    ...), a plain keyword search also returns isolated single components — switch to
    rcsb_search_combined and pair this keyword with rcsb_assembly_info.* composition filters (e.g.
    polymer_entity_instance_count_protein >= 6, or polymer_composition = "heteromeric protein") to
    keep the assembled complexes.

    Matching spans ALL text annotations, so a hit may be a spurious keyword match rather than a
    real answer. After searching, JUDGE each hit's relevance yourself: read its title (in
    `details` when enrich=True) and, for borderline cases, fetch its PubMed abstract
    (rcsb_get_entries -> pubmed.rcsb_pubmed_abstract_text); decide whether that text actually
    supports the user's question, and treat a low `score` as only a weak hint.

    Args:
        query: Free-text terms matched (case-insensitively) against all text annotations.
            Quote a multi-word phrase to require the words adjacent/in order (e.g.
            '"DNA polymerase"'); separate words narrow the results (most must match).
            Trailing '*' is a prefix wildcard. AND/OR/NOT are NOT boolean operators here —
            for boolean logic across conditions use rcsb_search_combined.
        return_type: What to return (default "entry"); one of entry, polymer_entity,
            non_polymer_entity, polymer_instance, assembly, mol_definition (see the
            "Return types and fetching details" note in the server instructions).
        limit: Max number of hits to return (1-100).
        offset: Number of hits to skip, for paging (default 0). The response's
            next_offset/has_more report whether more pages remain; pass next_offset
            back here with the same query to fetch the next page.
        all_hits: Return the COMPLETE result set in one call, for an explicit "ALL ..."
            request. Ignores limit and omits the paging fields; can't be combined with
            offset (the Search API rejects pagination here). Refused above 10000 hits —
            narrow the query, aggregate with rcsb_search_facets, or page instead. enrich
            still annotates only the first 25 hits.
        include_computed_models: Also search computed structure models (AlphaFold etc.).
        enrich: If true, attach title/method/resolution for each entry hit.
        group_by_identity: If set (100/95/90/70/50/30), collapse redundant hits into
            sequence-identity clusters and return one representative each; forces
            return_type to "polymer_entity".
        group_by_uniprot: If True, collapse hits to one representative per UniProt accession
            (non-redundant by protein); forces return_type to "polymer_entity". Mutually
            exclusive with group_by_identity.
        group_by_ranking: With group_by_identity or group_by_uniprot, which member to keep as
            each cluster's representative — an attribute path (e.g.
            "rcsb_entry_info.resolution_combined", "rcsb_accession_info.initial_release_date")
            or "score" (relevance), or "coverage" (group_by_uniprot only — keeps the
            structure covering the most of the UniProt sequence; ignores direction).
            Omit for RCSB's default (highest score).
        group_by_ranking_direction: "asc" or "desc" (default "desc") for group_by_ranking —
            e.g. resolution_combined + "asc" keeps the best-resolution structure per cluster;
            initial_release_date + "desc" keeps the most recent.

    Returns:
        {total_count, returned, offset, has_more, next_offset, hits:[{id, score}],
        query_editor_url}; "details" (per-entry title/method/resolution) is added when enrich.

    whenever the request resolves to a clear attribute and value. If you don't know
    the exact attribute path or its operators, call `rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes` first.

    For a biological concept, resolve it to an ontology id first and filter on the matching
    annotation attribute: disease -> rcsb_find_disease_terms;
    function/process/location -> rcsb_find_go_terms; domain/family/fold -> rcsb_find_interpro_domains;
    enzyme/reaction -> rcsb_find_enzyme_classes; organism common name/clade -> rcsb_find_organisms.
    If a resolver returns no usable id, or a concept/annotation filter yields no hits, fall
    back to rcsb_search_fulltext for the concept. (For ordinary constraints — resolution, organism,
    dates — an empty result is a valid answer: report it, don't keyword-search instead.)

    Examples:
        - High-resolution structures:
          attribute="rcsb_entry_info.resolution_combined", operator="less", value=2.0

          operator="greater", value="2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        - Has any ligand annotated (no value needed):
          attribute="rcsb_nonpolymer_entity.pdbx_description", operator="exists"

    Args:
        attribute: A dotted RCSB attribute path. If you don't know the exact path, call
            rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes first; the full list is also at
            https://search.rcsb.org/structure-search-attributes.html.
        operator: Operators are TYPE-SPECIFIC — use one of the operators that
            rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes reports for this attribute. As a guide:
            strings use contains_words/contains_phrase (free text) or exact_match/in
            (enumerated values); numbers and dates use greater, greater_or_equal, less,
            less_or_equal, equals, range; any type supports exists.
        value: The comparison value — a string/number, a list (for the "in" operator),
            or a range object {from, to, include_lower, include_upper} (bounds are
            EXCLUSIVE unless include_lower/include_upper are true). Omit for "exists".
            Dates take a full ISO-8601 timestamp, e.g. "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z".
        return_type: What to return (default "entry"); one of entry, polymer_entity,
            non_polymer_entity, polymer_instance, assembly, mol_definition (see the
            server instructions). E.g. return_type="entry" with a ligand attribute
            finds the structures that contain it.
        limit: Max hits (1-100).
        offset: Number of hits to skip, for paging (default 0); pass the response's
            next_offset back with the same query to fetch the next page.
        all_hits: Return the COMPLETE result set in one call, for an explicit "ALL ..."
            request. Ignores limit and omits the paging fields; can't be combined with
            offset (the Search API rejects pagination here). Refused above 10000 hits —
            narrow the query, aggregate with rcsb_search_facets, or page instead. enrich
            still annotates only the first 25 hits.
        enrich: Attach entry metadata when return_type is "entry".
        negation: Invert the match (e.g. "not Homo sapiens").
        case_sensitive: Match the value case-sensitively (default insensitive).
        group_by_identity: If set (100/95/90/70/50/30), return one representative per
            sequence-identity cluster; forces return_type to "polymer_entity".
        group_by_uniprot: If True, return one representative per UniProt accession
            (non-redundant by protein); forces return_type to "polymer_entity". Mutually
            exclusive with group_by_identity.
        group_by_ranking: With group_by_identity or group_by_uniprot, which member to keep as
            each cluster's representative — an attribute path (e.g.
            "rcsb_entry_info.resolution_combined", "rcsb_accession_info.initial_release_date")
            or "score" (or "coverage" — group_by_uniprot only, the most complete structure
            per accession; ignores direction). Omit for RCSB's default.
        group_by_ranking_direction: "asc" or "desc" (default "desc") for group_by_ranking
            (e.g. resolution_combined + "asc" = best-resolution representative).
        chemical: Set True for a chemical-component attribute (a path from
            rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes(schema="chemical"), e.g. "chem_comp.formula_weight").
            Switches to the text_chem service; usually pair with return_type="mol_definition".

    Returns:
        {total_count, returned, offset, has_more, next_offset, hits:[{id, score}],
        query_editor_url}; "details" (per-entry title/method/resolution) is added when enrich.

            request. Ignores limit and omits the paging fields; can't be combined with

        sort_direction: "asc" or "desc" (default "asc").
        group_by_identity: If set (100/95/90/70/50/30), return one representative per

            (non-redundant by protein); forces return_type to "polymer_entity". Mutually
            exclusive with group_by_identity.
        group_by_ranking: With group_by_identity or group_by_uniprot, which member to keep as
            each cluster's representative — an attribute path (e.g.
            "rcsb_entry_info.resolution_combined", "rcsb_accession_info.initial_release_date")
            or "score" (or "coverage" — group_by_uniprot only, the most complete structure
            per accession; ignores direction). Omit for RCSB's default.
        group_by_ranking_direction: "asc" or "desc" (default "desc") for group_by_ranking
            (e.g. resolution_combined + "asc" = best-resolution representative).
        chemical: Set True when the filters target chemical-component attributes (paths
            from rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes(schema="chemical")); switches them to the
            text_chem service. The full_text term always uses full-text search.
