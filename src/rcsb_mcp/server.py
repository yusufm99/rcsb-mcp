"""An MCP server for interrogating Protein Data Bank structures.

Spans three RCSB APIs so an LLM can take a question from discovery through detail:
- DISCOVER: search the Protein Data Bank (https://search.rcsb.org) by keyword,
  structural attribute, sequence, chemistry, 3D shape, or motif.
- INSPECT: fetch entry / entity / assembly / ligand metadata and annotations from
  the Data API (https://data.rcsb.org/graphql).
- RELATE: map alignments and positional annotations between sequence reference
  systems (UniProt, NCBI, PDB entity/instance) via the Sequence Coordinates API
  (https://sequence-coordinates.rcsb.org/graphql).

The Search API returns only identifiers, so a search is the first step: batch the
returned ids into the matching Data API tool for metadata, and an entry's component
ids let the agent drill top-down into its entities, assemblies, and ligands.

Run locally (stdio, for Claude Desktop / MCP Inspector):

mcp = FastMCP(
    name="rcsb_mcp",
    instructions="""You are an assistant for interrogating Protein Data Bank structures via the
RCSB Search, Data, and Sequence Coordinates APIs. You can:
- DISCOVER structures — find identifiers with the rcsb_search_* tools (keyword, attribute,
  sequence, chemical, 3D shape, structural/sequence motif). Every search response carries
  total_count (the full match count); pass `facets` to any rcsb_search_* tool to get a
  breakdown into buckets instead of hits.
- INSPECT structures — fetch detailed properties, experimental info, and annotations with
  the rcsb_get_* tools; use rcsb_describe_data_object to discover further fields to request.
- RELATE sequences — map alignments and positional features across PDB, UniProt, and NCBI
  with the rcsb_seqcoord_* tools.

Interrogation is usually multi-step; chain tools rather than relying on a single call:
- Find then detail: a search returns ids of ONE return_type — batch them into the matching
  rcsb_get_* tool for details (see "Return types and fetching details" below).
- Top-down: rcsb_get_entries returns an entry's component ids (rcsb_entry_container_identifiers:
  polymer/non-polymer/branched entity ids and assembly ids) — compose them with the entry id
  and feed them to rcsb_get_polymer_entities / rcsb_get_nonpolymer_entities / rcsb_get_assemblies, etc.
- Cross-reference: map an entry/entity to UniProt or NCBI with rcsb_seqcoord_alignments, and pull
  positional features with rcsb_seqcoord_annotations.

Choosing a search tool:
- When the request resolves to a clear attribute and value (e.g. resolution < 2 Å,
  organism = Homo sapiens, method = X-RAY DIFFRACTION, released after a date), prefer a
  STRUCTURED search: if you don't already know the exact attribute path, call
  rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes to find it, then use rcsb_search_by_attribute (it takes one
  or more attribute conditions combined with a single AND/OR; add a free-text keyword to them
  with rcsb_search_fulltext). This is more precise than a fulltext (keyword) search alone.
- Use rcsb_search_fulltext only for broad or exploratory keyword lookups where no specific
  attribute and value apply, or when the right search terms aren't yet known.
- A protein or gene NAME is a structured attribute, not a keyword — don't default to fulltext.
  For a protein name use rcsb_polymer_entity.rcsb_macromolecular_names_combined.name
  contains_phrase "<name>" (the deposited molecule name; broadest coverage), optionally OR'd with
  rcsb_uniprot_protein.name.value (canonical UniProt name, UniProt-mapped entries only). For a gene
  name/symbol use rcsb_entity_source_organism.rcsb_gene_name.value exact_match "<symbol>". These
  match the actual molecule/gene, not every annotation that mentions the word (e.g. "hemoglobin"
  -> ~750 real structures vs ~9000 fulltext hits). Combine with other attributes in one query; if
  the attribute search returns nothing useful, first try broadening it (contains_words, the
  UniProt name, a synonym) before resorting to fulltext.
- The specialized searches are chosen by INTENT: rcsb_search_by_sequence (sequence similarity),
  rcsb_search_by_chemical (SMILES/InChI/formula), rcsb_search_by_structure (whole 3D shape),
  rcsb_search_by_seqmotif (sequence pattern), rcsb_search_strucmotif (residue geometry). Each also
  accepts optional `attributes` (+ `logical_operator`) to AND/OR structured filters onto the match
  — e.g. sequence-similar AND from human AND resolution < 2 Å — in one call; reach for
  rcsb_search_advanced only to combine several of these services or for nested boolean logic.
- Searches return up to `limit` hits (default 10, max 100) plus pagination fields
  (offset/has_more/next_offset). For more results, re-issue the same query with offset set to
  the response's next_offset — don't just raise limit past 100.
- When the user asks for ALL matches (to enumerate or batch-fetch a complete set), set
  all_hits=True on any rcsb_search_* tool to get the whole set in one call instead of paging.
  It is capped at 10000 hits; above that, narrow the query, or read total_count / pass `facets`
  to summarize, instead.

Other capabilities:
- For "how many ..." questions, do NOT page hits: every search response includes total_count
  (the full match count, not just the returned page). Run the matching rcsb_search_* tool with
  limit=1 and read total_count.
- For "break down / distribution / per X" questions (e.g. structures per experimental method,
  per release year, per organism), pass `facets` to any rcsb_search_* tool to aggregate the
  matches into buckets instead of returning hits; the response is {total_count, facets:[{name,
  buckets:[{label, population}]}]}. Each facet spec is a dict {"name", "aggregation_type",
  "attribute", ...}:
    - "terms": count entries per distinct value. Optional min_interval_population (drop small
      buckets), max_num_intervals.
    - "histogram": numeric buckets — requires "interval" (bucket width, a number).
    - "date_histogram": calendar buckets — requires "interval": "year".
    - "range" / "date_range": requires "ranges": [{"from": x, "to": y}, ...] (from inclusive,
      to exclusive; dates as ISO strings).
    - "cardinality": count of distinct values (returns {name, value}).
  A facet may carry a nested "facets" list to sub-aggregate within each bucket. Example:
  facets=[{"name":"Methods","aggregation_type":"terms","attribute":"exptl.method"}].
- To DE-DUPLICATE redundant hits (one representative per cluster), set group_by on any
  rcsb_search_* tool (requires return_type="polymer_entity"):
  "seqid_30"/"seqid_50"/"seqid_70"/"seqid_90"/"seqid_95" (cluster by sequence-identity %) or
  "uniprot" (one per UniProt accession). Choose the representative with group_by_ranking
  (resolution / released_date / entity_residue_count / score). When group_by="uniprot", PREFER
  group_by_ranking="coverage" — it keeps the most relevant biological sequence 
  covering the most of the UniProt protein (coverage is valid only with group_by="uniprot").
- rcsb_search_strucmotif finds structures sharing a 3D arrangement of specific residues (a
  geometric motif); this is different from rcsb_search_by_structure (whole-shape similarity).
- To search chemical-component attributes (chem_comp.*, drugbank_info.*, rcsb_chem_comp_*),
  call rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes(schema="chemical") to find the path, then pass chemical=True
  to rcsb_search_by_attribute / rcsb_search_fulltext (usually with return_type="mol_definition").
- If request refers to assembly / complex / assembled complex / multi-subunit machine / multimer (or any
  other term indicating a structure composed of multiple subunits / proteins), add rcsb_assembly_info.* 
  composition to attributes to the appropiate rcsb_search_* tool:
    - rcsb_assembly_info.polymer_entity_instance_count_protein >= N (total protein chains),
    - rcsb_assembly_info.polymer_entity_count_protein >= M (distinct subunits),
    - rcsb_assembly_info.polymer_composition exact_match "heteromeric protein" | "homomeric protein"
  combine these as needed.
- For requests about a molecular FUNCTION ("kinase activity"), biological PROCESS ("DNA repair"),
  or cellular COMPONENT / location ("mitochondrial membrane"), first call rcsb_find_go_terms to resolve
  the phrase to a Gene Ontology id, then search with
  rcsb_polymer_entity_annotation.annotation_lineage.id exact_match "GO:..." (matches the term and
  all its descendants). This is far more precise than keyword search. Prefer terms with a higher
  pdb_entry_count; use the "in" operator with several GO ids to broaden.
- For requests referencing a protein DOMAIN, FAMILY, or fold ("SH2 domain", "immunoglobulin fold",
  "kinase domain"), first call rcsb_find_interpro_domains to resolve it to an InterPro id, then search
  with rcsb_polymer_entity_annotation.annotation_id exact_match "IPR..." (add .type="InterPro" to be
  explicit; "in" with several IPR ids to broaden). Note: for InterPro use annotation_id (NOT
  annotation_lineage.id — its hierarchy is not expanded). Prefer higher pdb_entry_count.
- For requests about an ENZYME activity / class ("alcohol dehydrogenase", "DNA polymerase", "EC
  3.4.21"), first call rcsb_find_enzyme_classes to resolve it to an EC number, then search with
  rcsb_polymer_entity.rcsb_ec_lineage.id exact_match "<EC>" (hierarchical: a full EC finds that
  enzyme, a partial EC like "3.4.21" finds the whole sub-subclass; "in" with several to broaden).
  Prefer higher pdb_entry_count.
- For requests about a DISEASE or condition ("cystic fibrosis", "breast cancer"), first call
  rcsb_find_disease_terms to resolve it to a MONDO id, then search with
  rcsb_uniprot_annotation.annotation_lineage.id exact_match "MONDO:..." (UniProt-based disease
  annotation; lineage matches the disease and its subtypes; "in" with several to broaden).
  Prefer higher pdb_entry_count.
- For requests restricting by SOURCE ORGANISM or a higher taxon ("human", "mouse", "mammals",
  "bacteria", "Escherichia coli"), first call rcsb_find_organisms to resolve it to an NCBI taxon
  id, then search with rcsb_entity_source_organism.taxonomy_lineage.id exact_match "<taxId>" —
  pass the id as a STRING ("9606", not 9606). The lineage is each entity's full ancestor chain,
  so a species id finds that species and a clade id (e.g. "40674" = Mammalia) finds every
  organism beneath it; "in" with several to broaden. For a known exact species,
  ncbi_scientific_name exact_match also works. Prefer higher pdb_entry_count.
- FALLBACK: if a rcsb_find_* resolver returns no usable match (count 0, or all results have
  pdb_entry_count 0), the concept isn't covered by that ontology — fall back to a keyword search
  (rcsb_search_fulltext, optionally with attribute filters) for it. The resolver's response
  carries a "note" saying so. Also use full text for concepts no ontology covers (tissues, broad
  phenotypes, free-text descriptors).

Return types and fetching details:
- Every search returns identifiers of ONE return_type. The six valid types — with an example
  id and the Data API tool that fetches their full details — are:
    entry              whole structure      "4HHB"     -> rcsb_get_entries
    polymer_entity     one molecule         "4HHB_1"   -> rcsb_get_polymer_entities
    non_polymer_entity ligand entity        "4HHB_3"   -> rcsb_get_nonpolymer_entities
    polymer_instance   one chain            "4HHB.A"   -> rcsb_get_polymer_entity_instances
    assembly           biological assembly  "4HHB-1"   -> rcsb_get_assemblies
    mol_definition     chemical component   "HEM"      -> rcsb_get_chem_comps
- Search responses carry identifiers + scores ONLY — no titles, organisms, or other metadata.
  To present or reason about hits, take the returned ids and call the matching rcsb_get_* tool
  above (batch ALL ids into a single call) to get details — do not loop one id at a time.
- The rcsb_get_* and rcsb_seqcoord_* tools return a compact default field set. If you need a property
  they don't return, call rcsb_describe_data_object (Data API) or rcsb_describe_seqcoord_object
  (Sequence Coordinates) with [into=, query=] to find the exact field path, then pass it to
  the tool's `fields=` argument. `fields=` accepts EITHER dotted attribute paths
  (e.g. "rcsb_polymer_entity.pdbx_description") OR GraphQL nested-brace syntax
  (e.g. "rcsb_polymer_entity { pdbx_description }"), and the two may be mixed.
- Every search/Data/Sequence-Coordinates tool response includes a link to the interactive
  query editor for that exact request — `query_editor_url` (search) or `graphiql_url`
  (GraphQL). When you show your work, surface that link verbatim; never construct these
  URLs yourself."""

    refined with structured attribute filters.

    Best for broad or exploratory keyword lookups. Pass `attributes` to AND/OR the keyword
    with structured conditions (organism, resolution, method, dates, ...) in one query. When
    a request has NO keyword (only attributes), use rcsb_search_by_attribute; when it resolves
    to a clear attribute and value, prefer structured search — call
    rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes first to find the exact path and operators (more precise,
    avoids spurious keyword matches). For NESTED boolean logic or other services
    (sequence/structure/chemical/motif), use rcsb_search_advanced.

    BEFORE keyword-searching a biological CONCEPT, try to resolve it to an ontology id first
    and filter on the annotation (far more precise):
      - disease / condition (e.g. "diabetes", "cancer")   -> rcsb_find_disease_terms
      - molecular function / process / location            -> rcsb_find_go_terms
      - protein domain / family / fold                     -> rcsb_find_interpro_domains
      - enzyme / catalyzed reaction                        -> rcsb_find_enzyme_classes
      - organism common name / clade (e.g. "human", "mammals") -> rcsb_find_organisms
    Each returns ids to use as an `attributes` filter on the matching annotation attribute.
    If a resolver finds no usable match (count 0, or all pdb_entry_count 0), the concept isn't
    covered by that ontology — THEN fall back to a plain keyword search here for the concept.

    For search for an assembly / complex / multi-subunit machine / multimer (or any other term indicating a structure
    composed of multiple subunits / proteins) add rcsb_assembly_info.* to `attributes`:
    - rcsb_assembly_info.polymer_entity_instance_count_protein >= N (total protein chains),
    - rcsb_assembly_info.polymer_entity_count_protein >= M (distinct subunits),
    - rcsb_assembly_info.polymer_composition exact_match "heteromeric protein" | "homomeric protein"
    combine these as needed to search for multimeric structures.

    Matching spans ALL text annotations, so a hit may be a spurious keyword match rather than a
    real answer. The response carries identifiers + scores only, so after searching, JUDGE each
    hit's relevance yourself: fetch its title (and, for borderline cases, its PubMed abstract)
    with rcsb_get_entries (-> struct.title / pubmed.rcsb_pubmed_abstract_text); decide whether
    that text actually supports the user's question, and treat a low `score` as only a weak hint.

    Args:
        query: Free-text terms matched (case-insensitively) against all text annotations.
            Quote a multi-word phrase to require the words adjacent/in order (e.g.
            '"DNA polymerase"'); separate words narrow the results (most must match).
            Trailing '*' is a prefix wildcard. AND/OR/NOT are NOT boolean operators here —
            for boolean logic across conditions use `attributes` (flat) or rcsb_search_advanced.
        attributes: Optional structured conditions combined with the keyword — a list of
            AttributeFilter {attribute, operator, value, negation?, case_sensitive?} (see
            rcsb_search_by_attribute / rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes for paths and operators).
        logical_operator: Combine the keyword and all attribute conditions with "and"
            (default) or "or".
        return_type: What to return (default "entry"); one of entry, polymer_entity,
            non_polymer_entity, polymer_instance, assembly, mol_definition (see the
            "Return types and fetching details" note in the server instructions).
        limit: Max number of hits to return (1-100).
        offset: Number of hits to skip, for paging (default 0). The response's
            next_offset/has_more report whether more pages remain; pass next_offset
            back here with the same query to fetch the next page.
        all_hits: Return the COMPLETE result set in one call, for an explicit "ALL ..."
            request. Ignores limit and omits the paging fields; can't be combined with
            offset (the Search API rejects pagination here). Refused above 10000 hits —
            narrow the query, aggregate by passing `facets`, or page instead.
        include_computed_models: Also search computed structure models (AlphaFold etc.).
        chemical: Set True when `attributes` target chemical-component attributes (the
            text_chem service; usually pair with return_type="mol_definition").
        facets: Optional aggregation specs to return a breakdown / distribution of the matches instead of
            hits (see the faceting note in the server instructions for the spec).
        sort_by: Attribute path to sort by (e.g. "rcsb_entry_info.resolution_combined");
            omit to sort by relevance score.
        sort_direction: "asc" (default) or "desc" for sort_by.
        group_by: Collapse redundant polymer_entity hits into clusters, returning one
            representative each — "seqid_30"/"seqid_50"/"seqid_70"/"seqid_90"/"seqid_95"
            (cluster by that sequence-identity %) or "uniprot" (one per UniProt accession).
            Only available with return_type="polymer_entity".
        group_by_ranking: Which member to keep as each cluster's representative (each ranking
            has a fixed direction): "resolution" (best resolution structure), "released_date" (most recent),
            "entity_residue_count" (longest), "score" (best ElasticSearch score), or "coverage" (most
            relevant biological sequence — requires group_by="uniprot", and recommended
            there). Omit for RCSB's default.
    Returns:
        {total_count, returned, offset, has_more, next_offset, hits:[{id, score}],
        query_editor_url}. Hits are identifiers only — batch them into rcsb_get_entries
        (or the rcsb_get_* tool matching return_type) for titles and other metadata.
        With all_hits, the offset/has_more/next_offset paging fields are omitted. With `facets`,
        instead returns {total_count, facets, query_editor_url}.

            {from, to, include_lower, include_upper} object (bounds EXCLUSIVE unless the
            include flags are true). See rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes for paths/operators.
        logical_operator: Combine the conditions with "and" (default) or "or".
        return_type: What to return (default "entry"); one of entry, polymer_entity,
            non_polymer_entity, polymer_instance, assembly, mol_definition (see the
            server instructions). E.g. return_type="entry" with a ligand attribute
            finds the structures that contain it.
        limit: Max hits (1-100).
        offset: Number of hits to skip, for paging (default 0); pass the response's
            next_offset back with the same query to fetch the next page.
        all_hits: Return the COMPLETE result set in one call, for an explicit "ALL ..."
            request. Ignores limit and omits the paging fields; can't be combined with
            offset (the Search API rejects pagination here). Refused above 10000 hits —
            narrow the query, aggregate by passing `facets`, or page instead.
        group_by: Collapse redundant polymer_entity hits into clusters, returning one
            representative each — "seqid_30"/"seqid_50"/"seqid_70"/"seqid_90"/"seqid_95"
            (cluster by that sequence-identity %) or "uniprot" (one per UniProt accession).
            Only available with return_type="polymer_entity".
        group_by_ranking: Which member to keep as each cluster's representative (each ranking
            has a fixed direction): "resolution" (best resolution structure), "released_date" (most recent),
            "entity_residue_count" (longest), "score" (best ElasticSearch score), or "coverage" (most
            relevant biological sequence — requires group_by="uniprot", and recommended
            there). Omit for RCSB's default.
        chemical: Set True for chemical-component attributes (paths from
            rcsb_list_pdb_search_attributes(schema="chemical"), e.g. "chem_comp.formula_weight").
            Switches to the text_chem service; usually pair with return_type="mol_definition".

            hits (see the faceting note in the server instructions for the spec).

    Returns:
        {total_count, returned, offset, has_more, next_offset, hits:[{id, score}],
        query_editor_url}. Hits are identifiers only — batch them into rcsb_get_entries
        (or the rcsb_get_* tool matching return_type) for titles and other metadata.
        With all_hits, the offset/has_more/next_offset paging fields are omitted. With `facets`,
        instead returns {total_count, facets, query_editor_url}.

            Only available with return_type="polymer_entity".
        group_by_ranking: Which member to keep as each cluster's representative (each ranking

    The Sequence Coordinates analogue of rcsb_describe_data_object. The rcsb_seqcoord_* tools
    return a compact default selection; use this to find what else you can request via
    their `fields=` argument (or via rcsb_seqcoord_graphql).

    Workflow: rcsb_describe_seqcoord_object("alignments") -> spot a nested object such as
    "target_alignments" -> rcsb_describe_seqcoord_object("alignments", into="target_alignments")
    to list its leaves -> call rcsb_seqcoord_alignments(..., fields="target_alignments{ ... }").

    Each returned field has name, kind ("scalar" leaf or "object" — drill in with `into`),
    type, list (whether it's a list), and description (when present).

    Args:
        object_key: A Sequence Coordinates root field — one of: alignments, annotations,
            group_alignments, group_annotations, group_annotations_summary. (alignments and
            group_alignments share the SequenceAlignments type; the annotation roots share

            "target_alignments" or "features.feature_positions".
        query: Optional case-insensitive keyword to filter fields by name/description.

    This is the tool for "which X identifiers correspond to this sequence?" across

    use THIS tool for NCBI RefSeq protein / genome mappings (and PDB<->UniProt too).
    The returned target_alignments[].target_id values are the mapped identifiers in
    the to_ref system, each with its aligned regions.

    To answer a question about a whole entry, first get its polymer entity ids
